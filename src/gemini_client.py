Provide a systematic identification analysis in this exact structure:
## üéØ TOP CANDIDATES
List the 3 most likely species. For each, provide a **Match Confidence** percentage. Justify your choice by listing key **Matching Features** and any **Discrepancies**. Consider the GBIF record count as an indicator of how common a species is.
## üîç DIAGNOSTIC COMPARISON
Create a markdown table comparing the most important diagnostic features (e.g., leaves, flowers, habit) of the user's specimen against your top candidates.
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS & NEXT STEPS
What single, key feature would best confirm the identification? What should the user look for or photograph next to be certain?

**AVAILABLE SPECIES DATA (from local e-Flora):**
{combined_descriptions}
**CONTEXTUAL DATA:**
{metadata_summary}
{failed_summary}
**YOUR TASK:**
Create a practical field guide using this exact structure, focusing only on the species for which descriptions were provided.
## üåø QUICK IDENTIFICATION MATRIX
Create a markdown table comparing the most diagnostic features (e.g., Habit, Leaf Shape, Flower Color, Habitat) for all available species. Use the GBIF record count to hint at which species are more commonly encountered.
## üîë SIMPLE DICHOTOMOUS KEY
Create a simple, practical dichotomous key to help differentiate between these species.
**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
1.  Each lead of a couplet (e.g., `1a` and `1b`) **MUST** be on its own, separate line. **NEVER** combine `...a` and `...b` leads onto the same line.
2.  Do not use dot leaders (`.......`).
3.  Use an arrow `->` to point to the result.
4.  Bold the species name or the "Go to" instruction.
**EXAMPLE OF PERFECT FORMAT:**
1a. Flowers yellow -> **Go to 2**
1b. Flowers white or pink -> **Go to 3**
2a. Leaves needle-like -> ***Species A***
2b. Leaves broad -> ***Species B***
3a. Shrub over 1m tall -> ***Species C***
3b. Shrub under 1m tall -> ***Species D***
## üëÄ KEY FIELD MARKS
For each species, list the 2-3 most distinctive "at-a-glance" features that a botanist in the field could use for rapid identification.
